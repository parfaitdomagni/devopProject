scenario 2: in a git local repository add more files, edit some files, remove somefiles & add to staging area then commit the changes for every change accordingly 

	cd ProjectA ( switch into the project direcotry in which git init command was ran )
	touch heloworld.java readme.txt ( creates new empty files )
	git status -- to check changes made
	git add . ( we can give the individual file names OR just give dot (.) to stage all the changes in the project )
	git commit -m "added files"
	vi heloworld.java ( opens the file in editor - enter some text & save it )
	git status -- to check changes made
	git add .
	git commit -m "modified heloworld.java"
	rm abc.java ( removes the files from project ProjectA direcotry )
	git status -- to check changes made
	git add .
	git commit -m "deleted abc.java"

	Note: like above you can add & commit each change you do OR you do all changes in a repository then at the end you can add & commit them all together also, its completely how you want to do it.
